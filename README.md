# Customer Churn Prediction

Machine learning project to predict customer churn using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. The project identifies customers likely to leave a service, evaluates model performance, and provides business-focused insights with visualizations.

## Project Overview
 Customer churn is one of the biggest challenges for subscription-based businesses such as telecom, banking, and SaaS. Retaining existing customers is often more profitable than acquiring new ones.  
 This project builds a churn prediction system that:
 Cleans and explores customer data
 Engineers meaningful features (e.g., contract type, payment method, service usage)
 Trains multiple machine learning models
 Evaluates performance with precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
 Predicts churn probabilities per customer
 Visualizes key churn drivers
 Summarizes insights in a business-focused report

## Tools and Technologies
 Python: Data analysis and modeling
 Pandas, NumPy: Data preprocessing
 Scikit-learn: Machine learning models and evaluation
 XGBoost: Advanced classification model
 Matplotlib, Seaborn: Data visualization
 Streamlit or Power BI (optional): Dashboards
